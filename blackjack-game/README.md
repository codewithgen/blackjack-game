## What I learn

My key takeaways from this projects the importance of function and how they work. It was fun and interesting learnign about for loop statements such as:


<function renderGame() {
    cardsEl.textContent = "Cards: "
    for (let i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
        cardsEl.textContent += cards[i] + " "
    }>
